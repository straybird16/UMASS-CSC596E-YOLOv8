1. ToDo:

    (1) Add 3 different rotations to the tranining (is it necessary?) to let the model generalize better.
    (2) Add more SnapChat GUI elements (e.g., video call UI) to the image generation and train with them
    (3) Fully randomize the text generation in textbars & GUI elements that may contain text.
    (4) Realize the removal of common phone GUI elements (e.g., all sorts of sidebars, topbars, iphone white dots, etc.) 


2. Results and Findings

    0.97 F1 score at 0.64 confidence level (I'd say it's more than enough. But of course we need to accomplish more
    complicated tasks)

    (1) Small model seems to perform considerably better than the nano model, while taking only a little more time to train.
        (have to verify this with more training epochs, may be due to other factors)
    (2) Transfer learning from existing model is also faster than training from scratch.
    (3) Till now, the typical training time for nano model on 1000 400x300 PNG images over 10 epochs is 100 min; 
        

3. Thoughts

    (1) Because of how well the YOLO model performs so far and the simplicity of adding elements 
        for the existing model to learn, we can even consider adding a feature that automates 
        the whole process and allows users to specify elements they want the model to remove automatically.
